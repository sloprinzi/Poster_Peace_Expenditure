Poster: Peace and Military Expenditure 
================

## About the Poster 

Welcome to my poster page! This poster was created for my Data Analysis course in Spring 2023 to look at creating an OLS regression from public data. Using the Quality of Government (QoG) global dataset, the following poster on military  expenditure and peace was reviewed. 


### Background


With events like the war in Ukraine and post-COVID food insecurity and political instability, peacefulness has declined to its lowest levels in 15 years[^1]. In 2021 the economic impact of violence on the global economy was $16.5 trillion, about ten percent of the world's total economic activity or $2,117 per person ^[Institute for Economics & Peace (2022, A). Global Peace Index 2022: Measuring Peace in a Complex World, Sydney. Available from: http://visionofhumanity.org/resources (accessed May 8, 2023).]. In these times of low levels of peace, countries like the US, China, and Iran have increased their military spending, however will increased military expenditures lead to peace?


Since 2008, 112 countries have reduced their armed forces, while 42 countries have increased theirs leading to an overall increase in global military spending. With this increase in military spending but peace being at the lowest levels in years, what is the relationship between peace and military spending? This study aims to explore the following question: 


**_Is there a relationship between peace and military expenditures?_** 


### The Data

The data in this study comes from the QoG dataset^[Teorell, Jan, Aksel Sundström, Sören Holmberg, Bo Rothstein, Natalia Alvarado Pachon, Cem Mert Dalli & Yente Meijers. 2023. The Quality of Government Standard Dataset, version Jan23. University of Gothenburg: The Quality of Government Institute, https://www.gu.se/en/quality-government doi:10.18157/qogstdjan23]. This data compiles data from more than 100 data sources around the world. In particular, the Global Peace Index^[Institute for Economics and Peace. (2022b). Global peace index 2022: Measuring peace in a
complex world [Accessed 01-09-2022]. http://visionofhumanity.org/resources] and the Global Militarization Index^[Bayer, Markus and Paul Rohleder. (2022). Global Militarization Index 2022. Bonn International
Center for Conversion BICC. https://gmi.bicc.de/] studies and datasets were used from the overall QoG dataset. 


From the data sets above, the variables Global Peace Index (GPI) and Military Expenditure were chosen. To mitigate bias due to confounding variables, GDP per Capita and Ongoing Conflict were also looked at. 


To try the example yourself, you can find the dataset above labeled `qog.csv`.
